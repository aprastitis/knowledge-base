## [2026-05-21] Anthropic Claude Code talk — 3 engineering cards
**Material:** Anthropic conference talk (YouTube video, 46 min, Welsh Whisper transcription)
**Decisions:**
- All 3 cards go to `engineering/` — they're about engineering practices and implementation patterns, not pure concepts or mental models
- `agentic-coding-tools.md` — covers tool usage, production numbers, new features; intended as a practical reference when tackling issues or building skills
- `advisor-pattern-for-ai-agents.md` — directly relevant to tool/skill building (which model for which task type)
- `scaffolding-for-ai-agents.md` — directly relevant to being efficient and secure (how tooling determines outcomes; security scanning in context)
- Linked existing cards (`agentic-coding-principles`, `vibe-coder-security-checklist`) via See Also
**Outcome:** All 3 pushed to GitHub.

## [2026-05-21] Skill-building docs from Anthropic + OpenAI
**Material:** Two PDFs shared by Andreas
**Decisions:**
- All 4 cards go to `engineering/` — they're engineering practices, not concepts or mental models
- `progressive-disclosure-pattern` — the core architectural pattern from the Anthropic guide; this is the most important one from that doc
- `skill-trigger-design` — directly actionable; how to write descriptions that trigger correctly
- `ask-mode-before-code-mode` — from OpenAI doc; directly applicable when tackling complex tasks
- `agents-md-for-persistent-context` — from OpenAI doc; already something I do partially but this clarifies the pattern
- Stored both PDFs in `raw/` — Andreas confirmed raw material should be kept alongside synthesized cards
**Outcome:** All pushed to GitHub.
