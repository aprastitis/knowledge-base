## [2026-05-21] Anthropic Claude Code talk — 3 engineering cards
**Material:** Anthropic conference talk (YouTube video, 46 min, Welsh Whisper transcription)
**Decisions:**
- All 3 cards go to `engineering/` — they're about engineering practices and implementation patterns, not pure concepts or mental models
- `agentic-coding-tools.md` — covers tool usage, production numbers, new features; intended as a practical reference when tackling issues or building skills
- `advisor-pattern-for-ai-agents.md` — directly relevant to tool/skill building (which model for which task type)
- `scaffolding-for-ai-agents.md` — directly relevant to being efficient and secure (how tooling determines outcomes; security scanning in context)
- Linked existing cards (`agentic-coding-principles`, `vibe-coder-security-checklist`) via See Also
**Outcome:** All 3 pushed to GitHub.
